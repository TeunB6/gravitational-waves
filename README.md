# gravitational-waves

This repository contains a project on denoising gravitational wave data from LIGO. This project is part of the course Waves & Optics at RUG. Gravitational waves are detected through the use of **very** large interferometers, capable of detecting very precise movements. These movements can be caused by gravitational waves, originating from large scale events in the universe. However, a large part of this strain data is noise. The goal of this project is to investigate different ways of removing this noise.
